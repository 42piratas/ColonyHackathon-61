# ColonyHackathon-61

## Skilled Volunteerism Platform

Our goal is to develop a framework for an ecosystem that rewards volunteers for utilising their expertise for social causes or projects. We aim to catalyse a revolution in voluunteering beyond physical man-hours but to allow a fine-tuned experience with like-minded and empowering projects.

## Background   

[Hum Qing Ze](https://github.com/Fishbiscuit), a.k.a. QZ, comes from Singapore, where volunteering your time for non-profits is a common occurence. However, there is an issue with effective volunteer management. The sector is shifting towards effective altruism where organisations do not simply aim for high volunteer numbers but work towards real social impact.
